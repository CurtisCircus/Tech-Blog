## Installation
Important installations would be express@4.18.2, sequelize@6.35.2, mysql2@3.9.0, bcrypt@5.1.1, dotenv@16.4.1, express-handlebars@7.1.2, express-session@1.17.3, express-validator@7.0.1, and connect-session-sequelize@7.1.7. To install any of these all you have to do is in your integrated terminal write npm i <dependency name>@<verion number. I wrote all dependencies as needed for installation.

## Usage
Once the site is running on heroku, all the user would have to do is make an account to be able to post and comment. If they don't want to make an account the site's contents would still be visable but the user would not be able to interact with the posts, nor be able to make their own.
